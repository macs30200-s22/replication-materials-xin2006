Introduction:
In the project, my research question is “How containment measures in the context of Covid-19 pandemic impact the crime rate and pattern in Chicago?”. The project aims to explore the change of criminal activity in the City of Chicago that caused by the containment measures regarding social distancing, such as lockdowns and WFH in the COVID-19 pandemic. By obtaining the monthly data about crime count, COVID-19 policy, and mobility trend, I would perform quantitative analysis based on time series to figure out how, when, and to what extend does the crime impacted by the social distancing.
